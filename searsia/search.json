To make Searsia an interesting solution for developers of web search applications, we want to provide them the means to easily and transparantly add advertisements as an independent source to Searsia. The advertisements must be recognisable as advertisements, they should not track the users of the search service, and it should be easy to switch them off. Advertisements in search engines are much more effective..."

In 2014, Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in the US conducted the following experiment: They asked people what candidate they would support in the Australian election, Tony Abbott or Julia Gillard? Then they let them search information about the candidates. However, the researchers did not tell the people that they manipulated the search results. People used a search engine for which..."

We search things about our health, about our sexual preferences, about our financial situation. Most search engines log our queries, and they hold on to that information, indefinitely. They also log our clicks. And they use this information to target us with advertisements. Sadly, the most vulnerable people in our society, people with bad health or with bad credit scores, are in..."

A Searsia search engine is a federation of search engines, like the European Union (EU) is a federation of countries. Within the EU, each countries has its own government and its own laws. Within Searsia, each search engine indexes whatever it likes and returns whatever it likes. Sites like Wikipedia, Amazon, Stack Overflow and YouTube provide their own search interface.

      "description": "Let’s go back to our three worries: Manipulation, Privacy, and Costs of crawling. What do you gain by installing Searsia? First, Searsia delegates queries to multiple search engines that it does not control. Even if one or two of those manipulate or censor their results, there will be other engines in the federation that show more objective results. Second, all queries go via Searsia, so engines in the federation can no longer track individual users. Of course, now Searsia will get all your..."

If not then search engines will likely object to being part of a Searsia federation.

For our current demonstration deployment, U. Twente Search , we have not seen any of the APIs returning..."

Recommender systems are usually classified into two categories based on how recommendations are made: 1) Collaborative recommendations, and 2) Content-based recommendations (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2005) .
